    <h1> My Ideal Day: </h1>
    My ideal day would unfold faraway, perhaps in Italy.
    At dawn, Iâ€™d watch the sunrise at the Apennines mountains, where the earth flows into lush-green slopes. <br><br>
    Embracing the carefree joy of a child, Iâ€™d frolic with friends in the fields and wish for frivolous things on dandelions. <br><br>
    As we head down the mountain weâ€™d take a detour, curiosity leading us to some farmers offering figs and olives. My friends and Iâ€™d join the olive harvest with an adventurous spirit, shaking fruit off trees and dragging nets to collect the yield. <br><br>
    By then, we wouldâ€™ve worked up an appetite from all the farm work. So weâ€™d head to lunch in Bologna for a three-course meal with my family. Following a parmigiana bianca for appetizer, Iâ€™d gorge myself on authentic spaghetti Bolognese with my mom and fight over the last bit of strawberry gelato with my sister. <br><br>
    While praising the meal to the waiter, Iâ€™d learn of unexpected understaffing jeopardizing the kitchen with early closure. With the managerâ€™s nod of approval, I grab a pair of menus and usher patrons to their seats, waiting tables until the end of lunch service. As a token of appreciation, Iâ€™d get an extra serving of gelato. <br><br>
    Following the hustle and bustle of the restaurant, I'd head to Treviso, Venice's quieter twin, for some alone time. Iâ€™d let my feet guide me without purpose as I meander through its labyrinthine city walls and narrow cobblestone streets. <br><br>
    Afterward, Iâ€™d go to Asinara Island, and shadow the national park rangers who oversee protected areas and wildlife. Then, for a well-deserved break, Iâ€™d go swimming in the refreshing sky-blue waters the park is famous for. Iâ€™d watch a herd of wild albino donkeys and stay there till the sun dyed the world in pinkish-orange hues. <br><br>
    Iâ€™d end the day by retiring at the Grand Park Hyatt Milan Hotel. The room would be luxurious, outfitted with exquisite marble and heated floors. Iâ€™d sink into fresh satin sheets, bidding the night farewell. <br><br>
    Iâ€™d think about the farmers, the chef, and the park rangers, who were strangers at sunrise, and friends by sunset. <br><br>
    <b>I envision an ideal day would be full of serendipitous interactions like these â€” ones that are unplanned, yet transformative, that shape me and my worldviews with the magic of unforeseen adventures.</b>

<h1> Poetic Journal Entires: </h1>

<body>
- The moon was obscured by an unusual haze: as if an artist had accidentally smudged her still-wet canvas with a fat paintbrush and found, to her horror, that the delicate clouds and serene night sky sheâ€™d labored over were marred by an imperfection.

<br><br>- For the first time in a long time, I felt the wind prickle the hairs on my skin. Real wind. Not the stagnant office air conditioning kind. Real wind - the cool kind that breaks through the humid air and signals an incoming storm. Real wind that blows all your hair into your face and violently rustles the trees and threatens to shake you off your footing. Real wind that smells of dirt and rain and clouds and sky. Wind that reminds you what itâ€™s like to actually feel something unsheltered by walls or a white ceiling. Real wind that makes you feel grateful to be alive.

<br><br>- Even nameless weeds are pretty when they bloom.

<br><br>- I just saw a shooting star. The moon is hiding. Maybe itâ€™s shy tonight.
<br>Update: I see the moon. Sheâ€™s smiling like a gingered toenail. She hangs low in the sky like ripe fruit, teasing to brush the tip of my neighborâ€™s roof. Heavy and drooping.

<br><br>- I have pieces of gravel, (or maybe itâ€™s turf from soccer 2 weeks ago?) in my sneakers. I imagine this is what pearls feel like for oysters?

<br><br>- I never realized that concrete sidewalks glittered under lampposts â€˜til now.

<br><br>- I am swiss cheese-of-knowledge. Holes everywhere. Gaps everywhere. Where does it start and end? No one knowsâ€¦
